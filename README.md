# faceExpression
In this build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). We Use OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them.
